## Background

The Covid-19 pandemic has proved catastrophic to healthcare systems on a global level mostly owing to the unprecedented implications it has had. Hospitals have had to build, develop, implement and assess SOPs within such short time frames that errors, inefficiencies, and losses have been inevitable. Time is a scarcity and the opportunity costs of healthcare workers developing SOPs at the expense of delivering care are endless. Furthermore, strategic and operational decisions are having to be made as and when the need arises without much prior thought. To help mitigate the burden on healthcare systems and specifically our frontline workers, we are proposing a Rapid Hospital Resource Management system that will help streamline logistics and workflows and provide macro and micro level analytics to help understand the risks and overall impact at a given timeframe as well as offer insights into future state scenarios via predictive modeling efforts that will enable health systems to be more proactive than reactive. More importantly, we seek to offer a user-friendly, simplistic, and interactive interface with optimized solutions using data-driven insights that will ultimately allow healthcare workers to focus on prioritizing delivering care to patients.
